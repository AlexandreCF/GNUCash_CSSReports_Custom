# GNUCash_CSSReports_Custom

After a fresh install of GNUCash none of the report style sheets was working properly, allowing the table to be larger than the page body element.
Also the graphs were collapsed.

I have added two lines of CSS code to solve the report view on my laptop.

I am manking this file public in case it can help someone else facing the same issue.

The customized lines are marked with: /* customization */
