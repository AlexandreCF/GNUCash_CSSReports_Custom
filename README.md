# GNUCash_CSSReports_Custom

After a fresh install of GNUCash none of the report style sheets was working properly with multi column report, allowing the table to be larger than the page body element.
Also the graphs were collapsed.

I have added two lines of CSS code to solve the report view on my laptop.
This is to be used in: Edit > Style Sheets > CSS-Based stylesheet

I am manking this file public in case it can help someone else facing the same issue.

The customized lines are marked with: /* customization */
